1.0 INTRODUCTION

Consider that your team has been contracted to implement a basic battery management system. You‚Äôve been given this document as a basic framework / specification for what the customer wants. The labs in this course break down the development process as ‚Äòmilestones‚Äô for the customer.

1.1 Development Phases

This project is the second phase in the development of a simple battery management system for high voltage electric transportation applications. The current phase focuses on ‚Äúfleshing out the system‚Äù: adding functionality to tasks that have been developed as part of the basic system architecture, modeling more of the instrumentation in hardware, implementing the high-level data/control flow, managing a dynamic scheduler (linked list), and adding further functional refinement to the display driver and alarm annunciation functions.

3.0 BACKGROUND

Did well on Project 2 and excited to design phase two!

3.1 Cautions and Warnings

Always practice safe software engineering‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt leave unused variables laying around.

Throwing your completed but malfunctioning design on the floor, stomping on it, and screaming ‚Äúwork you stupid fool, work‚Äù is typically not the most effective debugging technique‚Ä¶ although it is perhaps one of the more satisfying. When you are debugging your code, writing it, throwing it away, and rewriting it again several dozen times, this does little to fix what is most likely a design error. Such an approach is not highly recommended, but can keep you entertained for hours‚Ä¶ particularly if you can convince your lab partner to do it.

4.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES

In this lab, we will continue working with the Arduino Mega (the ‚ÄúSystem Controller‚Äù). This work has the following goals:

<ul>
<li>Introduce a dynamic task queue: Design, implement, and manage a dynamic task queue</li>
<li>Introduce hardware timing functions: Design, implement, and utilize a hardware- based system time base</li>
<li>Introduce interrupts and ISRs: Begin to work with internal and external interrupts and interrupt service routines</li>
<li>Introduce several peripheral devices and work with basic input and output operations
<ul>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Design and incorporate a console keypad and a local display console into the
system.
</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Implement I/O: Interface with external circuits to measure data using analog
and digital signals
</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Design and incorporate drivers for the measurement subsystem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement features to enhance safety</li>
<li>Add features and capabilities to an existing product:
<ul>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Implement and test the new features and capabilities of the system,</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Amend existing UML diagrams to reflect the new features: utilize UML
diagrams to model new, dynamic aspects of the system
</li>

This task initializes all: ‚Ä¢ Hardware

o System time base (timers, etc.)

o GPIO (general purpose input/output)

o Communication protocols (UART serial bus, etc) o Interrupts, etc.

7.2 Scheduling Task

The Scheduling Task is executed in the main loop ‚Äì for the Arduino language, this is the loop() function. This task takes care of scheduling and executing the system tasks that make the BMS function.

There are several methods for implementing the task queue and scheduling. We will transition from the Round Robin Scheduler to a Dynamic Scheduler in this project.

7.2.1 Dynamic Scheduler

The dynamic scheduler in this project will be much like the round robin scheduler in that it runs each task from the task queue in succession; however, the task queue will now be implemented as a doubly linked list of TCBs rather than an array of pointers to type TCB.

‚Ä¢ If a task is not to be run during the current round (i.e. the flag for executing that task is not set), the scheduler skips execution of that task.

‚Ä¢ Tasks shall be pre-emptable (each task may be interrupted). ‚Ä¢ If a task has nothing to do, it shall exit immediately.

In this lab, the ATMega Timer1 interrupt shall pace execution of all tasks within the main loop ‚Äì more on this to follow.

7.2.2 Dynamic Task Queue (TCB Linked List) Implementation

How to build the task queue?

The task queue is a doubly linked list of TCBs. The Schedule Task executes each TCB in the doubly linked list and then returns to the main loop where it is called again once the timing interrupt flag has been set ‚Äì more on the timer to follow.

Creating the Doubly Linked List of TCBs:

The TCBs shall be initialized with all task and data pointers at startup as was done in the previous project. To initialize the doubly linked list of TCBs:

‚Ä¢ The TCB‚Äôs linked list pointers, ‚Äúnext‚Äù and ‚Äúprev‚Äù, shall be set to point to the next and previous TCB in the list.

NOTE: A value of NULL shall be assigned to the ‚Äúprev‚Äù pointer at the head and the ‚Äúnext‚Äù pointer at the tail of the linked list.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 13">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
7.2.3 Associating Real Time with the Scheduler

The Schedule Task shall execute each TCB in the linked list sequentially without delay and then return to the main loop where it shall be called again after the hardware interrupt timer sets the flag to allow the main loop to cycle again (the next section provides more detail about implementing the hardware timer). Pseudocode below shows how the system time base flag functions to pace execution within the main loop:

while(1)

<pre>{ if( 1 == timeBaseFlag )  // check if timeBaseFlag has been set by timer
  {                        //   interrupt (interrupt runs once per global
</pre>
<pre>                           //   time base period)
</pre>
<pre>    timeBaseFlag = 0;      // clear timeBaseFlag so that the loop will only
                           //   run again after timer interrupt sets flag
</pre>
<pre>} } Scheduler();
</pre>
Be sure to implement your queue so that when it gets to the last element, it wraps back around to the head of the linked list.

7.3 Hardware Timer Interrupt: timerISR()

A hardware time base is implemented to set the execution rate for the scheduler. This execution rate is known as the system time base, aka the system time step, and is initialized in the Startup Task by attaching an interrupt with a fixed period. The interrupt task for the hardware timer shall set a flag that signals the main loop to cycle again.

To implement a timer interrupt in the ATMega, use the Timer1 library included with the lab assignment. The code snippets below show how to use this library:

<pre>#include &lt;TimerOne.h&gt;
</pre>
<pre>/****  STARTUP ROUTINE  ***/
   /*  Set the Timer 1 interrupt request (IRQ) frequency  */
   Timer1.initialize( time_in_uS );    // Set the timer period in uS
</pre>
<pre>   /*  Set the timer 1 IRQ function to be called  */
   Timer1.attachInterrupt(timerISR);   // Attach the interrupt service
</pre>
<pre>                                       //    routine (ISR)

Note that the flag is a shared variable that is passed to the Contactor Task. This tells the Contactor Task what state the user wants the battery to be in.
</li>
</ul>
7.5 Measurement Tasks: Sensor Measurements

Measurements shall be taken to provide both the BMS and outside world with the system state according to the block diagram in Figure 1.

7.5.1 Temperature, HV Current &amp; Voltage Measurements

At this stage in the project, we will be implementing temperature, current &amp; voltage measurements using analog inputs. Since we do not have actual temperature, current and voltage sensors, we will be simulating these sensors using test circuits as described in the next section.

7.5.1.1 Test Circuits for Simulated [0-5V] Analog Sensors: ANALOG INPUT

Description of circuit in real-world application:

HV voltage, HV current, and temperature sensors are some of the most important components of the battery management system. These sensors tell the system about the battery‚Äôs electrical and thermal state.

When designing these sensors, the full output range of the sensor is scaled to the input range of the microcontroller‚Äôs analog input pins for maximum resolution. In the case of the ATMega, the analog input range is [0, 5V].

Temperature sensor analog input scaling:

‚Ä¢ Temperature (-10¬∞C ‚Äì 45¬∞C sensor range scaled to analog input 0-5V)

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 17">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
HV voltage and current sensor analog input scaling:

<ul>
<li>HV terminal** voltage (0V ‚Äì 450V sensor range scaled to analog input 0-5V)</li>
<li>HV terminal** current (-25A ‚Äì 25A sensor range scaled to analog input 0-5V)
**Terminal means that the measurement is taken at the battery‚Äôs terminals.

Implementation:

These analog inputs shall be modeled using the circuit in Figure 2:

<ul>
<li>The potentiometer allows you to produce a variable voltage in the range [0, 5V],
which covers the range of each of the sensors.
</li>
<li>Note that the circuit requires a software-enabled pullup resistor within the ATMega.
This is configured in the Startup Task when initializing the input pin. If the pullup resistor is not enabled, you should only see 0V at the input no matter the resistance value of the potentiometer.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
7.5.2 High Voltage Interlock Loop (HVIL)

The HV Interlock Loop circuit will remain the same as implemented in the previous lab. As before, this measurement shall be stored in a shared variable for inter-task data exchange with the display, similar to the other measurement values.

7.5.2.1 Test Circuit for HVIL: DIGITAL INPUT

Description of circuit in real-world application:

The high voltage interlock loop is a circuit that detects whether or not all high voltage connectors are connected since its circuit runs alongside the high voltage cabling. The circuit

<div class="column">
provides a safety check for the battery management system to ensure that no exposed high voltage cabling is present under operating conditions.

There are many means to implement one of these loops and the detection circuit that reads whether the HVIL is OPEN or CLOSED. For this project, we will simulate a HVIL detection circuit that provides a digital reading to the microcontroller of whether the loop is OPEN or CLOSED.

Implementation:

The circuit in Figure 3 shows how to simulate the HVIL detection circuit‚Äôs connection to the microcontroller by using a DIP switch to OPEN and CLOSE the circuit. The expected input at the microcontroller should be (notice these are states):

<ul>
<li>OPEN DIP switch:

o Produces 5V at the digital input pin (reading logic 1) o LED will not light up

o HVIL is OPEN!</li>
<li>CLOSED DIP switch

o Produces 0V at the digital input pin (reading logic 0) o LED will light up

o HVIL is CLOSED, yay, no danger!

7.6 SOC Task: Calculating Battery State of Charge (SOC)

The battery management system shall track the state of charge (SOC) of the high voltage battery. There are many methods to calculate state of charge, with more advanced systems using coulomb counting and neural networks to track the charge state of the battery.

For this phase of the project, the following value shall be used for the SOC. As mentioned in Section 7.4.2, the touch screen display task will share access to the SOC variable.

‚Ä¢ State of Charge:

o Constant value of [0]

7.7 Contactor Task: Setting Contactors (signified by LED output)

As discussed in Section 7.7.1 ‚ÄúSimulated Contactor Output Circuit‚Äù, contactors are a safety mechanism to protect the external world from the high voltage potential inside the battery. Within the context of this lab, the functionality of the Contactor Task is to show that logic exists for actuating the contactors properly so that when a power circuit is made available to actuate an actual contactor solenoid, it would function as specified.

For the purposes of this lab, the Contactor Task shall actuate the digital output pin associated with the contactor simulation circuit defined in Section 7.7.1.

States for contactors are:

1. &lt;state1&gt;: ‚ÄúOPEN‚Äù (default/entry state) 2. &lt;state2&gt;: ‚ÄúCLOSED‚Äù

The logic for moving between these states is as follows:

<ul>
<li>Contactors shall be initially OPEN.</li>
<li>Contactors shall be set to OPEN if either or both of the following conditions are met:
o The HVIL Alarm is ‚ÄúACTIVE, NOT ACKNOWLEDGED‚Äù or ‚ÄúACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED‚Äù.

o User requests TURN OFF BATTERY (i.e. OPEN contactors)
</li>
<li>Contactors shall transition to CLOSED when the user inputs a request to TURN ON
BATTERY (i.e. CLOSE contactors) and the HVIL Alarm is ‚ÄúNOT ACTIVE‚Äù. NOTE: The HVIL Alarm is defined in Section 7.9.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 20">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
NOTE: Request to OPEN/CLOSE contactors shall come in the form of a flag from the Display Task‚Äôs Battery ON/OFF screen. The Contactor Task shall acknowledge the flag after it has acted upon it.

In a real-world system, the OPEN/CLOSE command for the contactors will likely come from another embedded controller in charge of components that the high voltage battery rails interfaces with. This exercise puts that command in the user‚Äôs hands and can be considered a debugging tool.

7.7.1 Simulated Contactor Output Circuit: DIGITAL OUTPUT

Description of circuit in real-world application:

High voltage contactors provide a means to disconnect the battery‚Äôs high voltage rails from the external world. A typical contactor for this application is actuated by a solenoid, which requires more current to actuate that the microcontroller can source / sink

ÔÉ†Important point to note! Microcontrollers are limited in their capability to drive digital outputs over a few watts. Most microcontrollers require external, board-mounted FETs to drive signals requiring higher power levels.

Implementation:

For the purposes of this exercise, the contactor shall be modeled using an LED in series with a resistor as shown in Figure 4. This circuit allows for software simulation with visual confirmation that the output pin is being actuated.

7.8 High Voltage Interlock (HVIL) Interrupt Routine

The HVIL interrupt routine shall immediately act upon a transition of the HVIL loop from CLOSED to OPEN. This task is associated with safety and, as such, is the quickest software method available to OPEN the contactors should HVIL transition to an unsafe state.

Conditions for triggering interrupt:

1. HVIL transitions from CLOSED to OPEN.

Actions taken during the interrupt:

<ol>
<li>Set the HVIL Alarm to ‚ÄúACTIVE, NOT ACKNOWLEDGED‚Äù, i.e. &lt;state2&gt; of the alarm states defined in 7.9.</li>
<li>OPEN contactors by writing to the output port directly from the interrupt routine.</li>

9.0 APPENDIX

9.1 Working with Interrupts

When working with interrupts, it is important to keep in mind the following:

<ol>
<li>Interrupts are asynchronous events that can originate in the software or in the
hardware; inside or outside of the processor.
</li>
<li>The interrupt level (the priority) of each interrupt is either predetermined by the
design of the processor or by processor-specific interface software.
</li>
<li>One must write an interrupt service routine (ISR). This routine provides the body of
the interrupt ‚Äì the code that is to be executed when the interrupt occurs. The ISR should be short and concise. It should only contain enough code to get a job done or to apprise the system that something needs to be done. The following are definite no‚Äôs when writing an ISR:

<ul>
<li>The ISR should not block waiting on some other event.</li>
<li>The ISR should not work with semaphores or monitors.</li>
<li>The ISR should not contain a number of calls to functions or perform recursive
operations (judgment call here). It‚Äôs easy to blow the stack.
</li>
<li>The ISR should not disable interrupts for an extended time.</li>
<li>The ISR should not contain dozens of lines of code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One must store the address of the ISR in the interrupt vector table. The table is essentially an array of function pointers, indexed according to the interrupt number. Providing the ISR and getting its address (pointer to that function) into the interrupt vector table varies with different environments. For the Arduino environment, use the attachInterrupt() function.</li>
<li>One must enable the interrupt.

This can be done globally ‚Äì all interrupts are enabled, or locally ‚Äì interrupt ‚Äòx‚Äô is enabled. Unless the interrupt is enabled, even if it occurs physically, it will not be recognized by the system.</li>
<li>One must acknowledge (or recognize) the interrupt when it occurs unless otherwise taken care of by the system (generally not the case). This has the effect of resetting the interrupt and allowing further interrupts of the same kind to recur. If the interrupt is not acknowledged, it may occur once then never again. The acknowledgement is usually done in the ISR. The Arduino environment automatically handles interrupt acknowledgment (see the Interrupts section of the Arduino Resources document for more information).</li>
<li>One must exit the interrupt properly.

Unlike a simple function call, the return from an interrupt is a bit more involved. Generally, there is a specific statement (not a simple return) that is used for exit and cleanup.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 26">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ol start="7">
<li>All variables accessed by the interrupt that are not constant should be declared VOLATILE since the interrupt service routine can change the value of the variable outside the control of a code section in which it appears. Think of the interrupt as a concurrently executing thread.
Note that declaring a variable VOLATILE is a directive to the compiler to load the variable from RAM instead of a temporary storage register in the CPU.
